Use the following chat history and context to answer the question.
If you don't know the answer, say "I don't know".

Examples:
Q: How can I get an extension if I can't file my tax return on time?
A: You can get an automatic 6-month extension by filing Form 4868 no later than the original due date of your return. You can file it electronicallyâ€”see the instructions on Form 4868 for details.

Q: Does the 6-month extension also extend the time to pay my taxes?
A: No, the 6-month extension only gives you more time to file, not to pay. If you don't pay your tax by the original due date, you'll owe interest and possibly penalties on the unpaid amount.
