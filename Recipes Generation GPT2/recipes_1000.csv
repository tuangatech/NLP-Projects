69,Chicha Peruana,"piloncillo cone, Nottingham dry yeast","Procedure: Mash for 90 minutes at 160°F. We did two 1.5 gallon batches, each spiced differently (one with curacao/coriander, the other with allspice/cinammon). We would rather have used a higher proportion of jora, but on brewday we discovered that our ability to determine the weight of things is seriously imparied. Instead of the 4.5lbs we thought we had, we found we had only 3lbs of jora. Rather than readjust (the OG would have been more appropriate at ~1.045 in any case), we added more sugar, a course of action that was inspired by homebrewed Weizen as much as anything else. The result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle. Be warned that chicha is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains some sweetness and body. Once the chicha ferments out, you are left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more than anything else. If I'd been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping), I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?) In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes. Specifics:  OG: 1.055  FG: 1.012 Types of Chicha So far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. These range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with. Facil (easy) - Corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germinate. The sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor. Abbreviated - The jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off. Traditional - Similiar to the Abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling. Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom. This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted). The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens. Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles. Also note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge. That is, the sweet liquor (upi) is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash. Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditional nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed). Chicha is traditionally allowed to spontaneously ferment. For the last type (Modern), George Duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn. This gooey mass would then be added to more water and barley malt and mashed as per 'normal' homebrew procedures. This could probably be sparged as usual."
70,Buckwheat Bread,"eggs, water, buckwheat flour, light brown sugar, whole wheat flour, buttermilk, salt, caraway seed, all-purpose flour","Proof the yeast in the lukewarm water with the sugar. After you get a yeast sponge add the buttermilk (room temperature), salt, eggs and the three different kinds of flour and caraway seeds. Mix well. Take the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, kneading until smooth. Place the dough in a large buttered bowl, cover with a towel and let stand in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk. This will take from 1~/2 to 2 hours. Take the dough out and punch it down a couple of times. Knead and shape the dough into a loaf and place in a buttered loaf pan (9~ by 5~). Let stand in a warm place, covered with a towel, to rise for about 1 hour or until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

The water should be added to the flour slowly to ensure that only the minimum amount of water is used. Do not over-mix the dough. When the dough has been mixed just sufficiently to combine the ingredients, form it into a ball and wrap in a piece of plastic wrap and refrigerate for several  hours. To prepare the filling, melt the butter in a large saute pan until it  begins to brown. Add the sliced apples and cook over medium heat until they begin to soften, about 2 to 3 minutes. In a bowl, combine the lemon juice, sugars, Southern Comfort, and  cinnamon. Add this mixture to the apples and cook 2 to 3 minutes over medium-high heat until the apples are completely caramelized and covered with all the sugar. Remove filling from the heat and  allow to cool. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. When ready to use, remove the dough from the refrigerator, lightly flour a pastry board and a rolling pin, and unwrap the dough. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and begin to roll out into a circle by rolling evenly outward from the center and turning   the dough in small 1/8th turns to keep the rolling even. When the  dough is  rolled out to an even thickness and is about 12 inches in  diameter and 1/8-inch thick, it is ready to be transferred to a 10-inch pie pan or plate. Lightly butter the pie plate, partially roll the dough up on the rolling pin, lift the dough and center it in the pie pan and unroll. Roll the second half of the pie dough into a round slightly larger than the pie pan. Fill the bottom crust with the cooked apples using a slotted spoon to drain the apples. Reserve juices if desired, for sauce. Brush an egg wash coating over the lip of the dough. This is where it will be sealed to the top  crust. Cover the apples  with the top half of the pie dough. Trim any excess  from the top  crust before using both hands to crimp the edges of the two crust together to seal. With a sharp knife, make several crosshatch slits in the top  crust. Brush with the egg wash and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool 20 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream. Reserved juices can be reduced with heavy cream for a sauce for the pie."

150,All-Purpose Crock Pot Chicken,"chicken, lemon pepper, salt, bell pepper, celery, carrot, green onion, garlic, water","If using thigh portions or a cut up fryer, etc, remove all skin and as much fat  as possible. I boil the skins with garlic for the dog. There is no need to bone  the chicken. Put about 1/4 inch water in the slow cooker. Rinse the chicken  well, getting into the crevices, and sprinkle with the Cajun seasoning on both  sides. Go easy at first; this is NOT low-salt and it tends to be a little spicy. I start immediately placing the chicken in the slow cooker. I rinse one piece,  season both sides, and layer it in the pot. When you are done seasoning all the  chicken (I generally do 2-3 lbs in a batch; less is not worth the time), cover  the pot and let the chicken stand for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, cover the chicken fully with water (don't skimp) and set the cooker on \,  Cooking time is up to you. A minimum of 8-10 hours is what I recommend.  I  usually set the chicken cooking in an afternoon, and let it cook overnight.  Often it will cook for 12-24 hours. This is an excellent dish for those of us  who never learned to properly debone a chicken ;) At the end of the cooking  time, merely pull out the chicken pieces and separate the bones from the meat.  It will literally fall apart. Save the broth for adding to mashed potatoes,  gravy, rice or soup. You will have a good deal of chicken here. Separate into  smaller portions and freeze."

627,Filet Mignon,"fresh white mushrooms, onion, butter, sweet vermouth, sherry wine, garlic, Worcestershire sauce","We rarely eat beef but when we do for special occasions we enjoy the above for a most tender cut of beef. Here is the way our family does it. There are other  methods of seasoning and roasting but we are always satisfied with the results  this way. Try to buy a whole fillet that is already \,  ( trimmed of  silverskin, fat etc. ) or if you prefer you can buy untrimmed and do it  yourself. The whole filet has a taped part ( called the tail ) and when you  roast, tuck this part under so you can have a more even  piece of meat for  roasting. If the whole filet is too large to fit your roasting pan you may cut  the filet in half and roast the two parts in the pan together. Make sure the  meat comes to room temperature prior to roasting for even roasting which also  helps with tenderness. Rub oil ( we prefer olive ) over the filet and then rub in seasonings such as salt , pepper, paprika, crushed garlic etc. The Montreal  Steak Seasoning is a nice choice ( available in the seasoning or meat sections  of supermarkets ) . Or other people prefer to coat the filet with Dijon mustard  and then roll the filet in  finely crushed black or colored peppercorns prior to roasting. Both ways are delicious. Place the filet on a  roasting rack over the  roasting pan. You can also place the filet over some beef bones in the pan which also act as a rack. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Place the prepared filet on the rack and  roast 20 minutes ( for a average 5 lb roast- ). Then decrease the temperature to 350F and roast an additional 20 minutes. Remove the filet from the oven and let  sit about 15 minutes before slicing. This total time factor  should produce  medium rare.  A heavier roast will probably need more roasting time and a  smaller roast less time. The sitting times allows for best slicing and lets some of the juices settle etc.    If you prefer you can  check and rely on a meat  thermometer to test so you don't under or over roast the meat.. Insert  thermometer in the thickest part of the roast. Generally 120 to 130 F is rare  and 130 to 140 F is medium rare. Remember the meat will continue to cook with  \,  out of the oven. Meanwhile make the mushroom sauce ( this is a natural and not thickened sauce ). In a large skillet over medium high heat cook the onion in some olive oil or butter until softened. Add the sliced mushrooms  and garlic and continue to cook and stir until the mushrooms have reduced in  volume by 1/2 and become tender. Add the vermouth, dashes of Worcestershire  sauce and Gravy Master (  a browning/ caramelized color for sauces etc. ). Cook  and stir  another 5 to 10 minutes and then season to taste.   If you wish you   may add a few tablespoons of the pan drippings or a bit of beef bullion paste (  available in jars ) for a richer flavor. The whole recipe really can serve  quite a lot depending on how thick or thin you slice the meat. Leftovers reheat  well."

678,Cream Scones,"flour, salt, baking powder, sugar, butter, eggs, heavy cream, raisins, water","Preheat the oven to 450. Mix dry ingredients together, reserving 1 Tbsp sugar. Cut butter into bits and rub into dry ingredients until thoroughly blended. (Or pulse in food processor).   Beat 2 eggs with cream, and blend into dry  ingredients with a few swift strokes. Use only a few more strokes to add  raisins. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead 10 times; no more.   If it is very sticky, add a little flour, but very little; don't worry if it  sticks a bit to your hands. Press the dough into a 3/4 inch rectangle and cut  into 2 inch rounds with a biscuit cutter or glass. Place the rounds on an  ungreased baking sheet.  Gently reshape the leftover dough and cut again; this  recipe will produce 10-14 biscuits. Beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoonful  of water and brush the top of each scone; sprinkle each with a little of the  remaining sugar. Bake 7-9 minutes, or until the scones are a beautiful golden  brown. These keep better than biscuits, but should still be eaten the same day  you make them. Seven Easy Additions to Cream Scones:, --Stir one-half cup or more chopped nuts into the prepared batter. --Use up to fifty percent whole wheat flour. --Substitute fresh fruit (apples, pears, peaches), whole berries (blueberries, cranberries) or minced dried fruit (figs, apricots) for the raisins. --Add one teaspoonful or more of cinnamon or ginger, or a pinch of nutmeg or allspice to the dried ingredients. --Add one-half cup grated cheese along with the eggs and cream; reduce the sugar to one teaspoon. --Add minced fresh herbs to taste-dill, parsley, and chevril are especially good; reduce the sugar to one teaspoonful. --Add one-half cup or more of minced cooked meat along with the eggs and cream; reduce the sugar to one teaspoon."

Remove from heat (butter should be completely melted) and add the flour  all in one fell swoop. Mix as quickly as possible with a sturdy wooden  spoon. This mixture is known as a \, . Return the saucepan to the  stove over the lowest possible heat. Continue to stir with the wooden  spoon while the panade dries out. This will take about 5 minutes, and a  thin crust will form on the bottom of the pan. This is supposed to  happen, so don't worry about it, and don't try to scrape it up and  incorporate it into the dough, or you will have plaster chips in your  pastries. The dough should be soft, but when you pinch it between thumb  and forefinger it should not stick to your hand. Dump the panade into a  bowl, and let it cool for at least 5 minutes. Then add the eggs, one at a  time, beating well after each addition. The mixture should be smooth and  creamy looking before you add the next egg. After all 4 eggs have been  beaten in, the dough will be shiny and satiny yellow, thick and heavy. Butter and flour a cookie sheet. Fill a pastry bag with the dough. If you  don't have a pastry bag, you can use a tablespoon to drop dollops of  dough onto the cookie sheet for eclairs and/or cream puffs, but you  really must have a pastry bag in order to make a cream puff ring. For cream puffs, Squeeze out balls about the size of ping pong or golf  balls. For eclairs, squeeze out oblongs at 3 to 4 inches long. If you are using  the recipe given above, you should end up with 14 to 16 pastries. Don't  succumb to the temptation to make fewer and larger ones, for they won't  cook properly if you do. Brush the tops of the pastries with beaten egg,  using the bristles of the brush to gently push down and flatten out the  little curlicues left by the pastry bag as you lifted it off. Finally,  drag the tines of a dinner fork down the length of each eclair. The  resulting stripes will make for a more attractive and professional  looking product. For a cream puff ring, first mark a 10\,  wide \,  of cream puff paste right on top of the circle you've  outlined. Squeeze another 1\, crack\, , , , , dry\, , , ,
